# Tic-Tac-Toe
  
This program was developed to allow a human play tic-tac-toe against a computer. Version 1 uses conditional statements (so not really ML). Version 2 will be coming soon and it will use reinforcement learning

## How to use the Program?
#### Version 1
In order to run the code, simply run `python3 main.py`
- *Human vs. Computer* (Default)
- *Computer vs. Computer*
  
  - Comment the 2nd to last line & Uncomment the last line (this will allow an 'intelligent' agent play against a random player)


```
NOTE: The purpose of this small project is to learn ML; feel free to make suggestions and comments regarding the code.
